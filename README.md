## üìù Frontend Details: React Form

- The form is built with **React Hook Form** for easy validation and state management.
- A generic `CustomForm` component renders fields dynamically based on config.
- The `DynamicFieldArray` component handles arrays of product line items, allowing users to add/remove rows dynamically.
- Validation is enforced using patterns and required flags.
- On submit, form data is sent as JSON to the FastAPI backend.
- On success, the backend responds with a PDF blob URL, and the user can download the invoice.

---

## üîß Backend Details: FastAPI & PDF Generation

- The backend exposes an API endpoint `/generate-invoice` which accepts invoice data via POST.
- Uses **Pydantic** models to validate request data.
- The invoice HTML template is rendered using **Jinja2** templates.
- **WeasyPrint** converts the rendered HTML invoice into a PDF.
- The PDF is sent back as a streamed file response for frontend to download.
